# King-News
A professional and elegant news website. This website is pretty similar to CNN and The New York Times. The color theme are gold, black and darkgrey.

## The Idea behind this poject ðŸ’¡
I wanted to stregthen my skill on `CSS- Grid`. The best way to do it, was to create a website, which is based on the latest news. The idea behind it, was to make somthing that is similar to "CNN" and "The New York Times", but at the same time more elegant and professional. The color theme is gold, black and dark grey, which are colors that doesn't bother the eyes so much when you look at all the text and images: Basically calm color for the eye.

## What I learned ðŸ§ 
- Heavely focused on `CSS-Grid` and the `design`
